BinaryCalculator performs calculations on binary integers. The program can perform addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication of two integers as well as calculate the square and square root of any integer.


Writing a binary integer is preformed by clicking 0s and 1s on the UI. Once the first integer is written, an operation should be selected. The next integer is input with the 0 and 1 buttons and the calculation is performed by pressing the = button. The resulting binary number is displayed.
